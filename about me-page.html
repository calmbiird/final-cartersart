			Carter is a multidisciplinary artist who specializes in 3D modeling and creative coding. As a second year at San Jose State University studying Digital Media Arts, Carter’s art always strives to be innovative while telling a compelling narrative. Through art series such as Coheart and The Call, Carter explores various mediums outside of his realm of expertise as a way to broaden his abilities and leave no stone unturned when it comes to the possibilities of storytelling.
			<p>
				Being a Kansas-native, Carter’s life has always been from one place to another. When he moved to California in the 2010’s, he found a community that cemented the state as his home. Surrounded by music producers, talented artists, and professional communicators during his childhood, he was accustomed to the lifestyle of an artist and the many mediums which art can take you through.
			</p>
			<p>
				It was through his time at university where Carter would fall in love with Computer Science as well as 3D modeling and begin to develop a work ethic which had those two mediums at the forefront. Carter’s art is all about narrative and always has a message behind it. Whether it be a loveletter to something in his life, an experience that moved him, or a topic at the peak of his interest, his art is the conveyor that brings all of it to life.
