			Ditched, heartbroken, and alone on Valentine’s Day, a box of chocolates meant for someone else finds its way to comfort you in the end. Encapsulating feelings of loneliness and self-worth, Love Hurts is a representation of loving yourself. Often in my life I have found myself at the mercy of someone else’s validation. In my early childhood, I rarely made time to understand my feelings and to love myself.
			<p>
				Now into my adult life I find that taking care of yourself is one of the most important things you can do with your time. When people let you down, when things don’t go your way, you are always still you and that is worth celebrating. It’s rare that in moments of extreme happiness we learn to start taking care of ourselves. So capturing a realistic and relatable feeling of getting let down and instead eating the chocolate yourself felt more fitting to match that feeling.
			</p>
			<p>
				This 3D rendering of a lonely Valentine’s Day scene is made in blender. The 3D modeling software warranted a limitless realm of possibilities which gave way to lighting techniques, sculpting, and set decoration. The warm lighting that emits onto the centerpieces replicates the spotlight of a lamp post on a park bench—emphasizing the theme of a lonely night. The chocolates, sculpted to replicate imperfect bumps and brandishes, fill the box to give depth to the models. The crumpled up wrappers symbolize chocolates that have already been eaten. This process allowed me to grow in my own journey of self worth while aiming to inspire others to do so as well.

		A sword, marking its territory in the ground from seemingly centuries ago. Its dried blood stains the steel of its previously polished edge. The mysterious origins of this sword as a relic of an ancient battle or final resting place of a withered knight create this unique atmosphere that encourages the viewer to ponder on its story.
		<p>
			The Dark Ages is inspired by the gothic caverns of “Dark Souls III” and the “fill-it-in” storytelling of famous director Quentin Tarantino. The sword itself is inspired by the weapon of choice of Cloud from “Final Fantasy”. The goal was to build a scene where the elements within are connected but the exact narrative is left ambiguous. Even I tell myself a different story regarding the sword and the chained lantern to its hilt when I view the piece. The mysterious nature of the piece allows the viewer to interpret its meanings and stretch its story beyond the frames.
		</p>
		<p>
			This piece was made using blender’s 3D modeling software and this medium allowed for the texture of mud and steel to set the realistic tone. Much like the previous,  Love Hurts, this piece explored the space of 3D and its unique tools for lighting and sculpture to realize a contained narrative.
