		<div class="statement">
			Emily’s Chamber is a conceptual narrative that places the audience in the point-of-view of a primary character. The video in the form of a box TV plays at the center of an endless negative space that draws your eyes to it directly, taking up just enough to where you must look at it. As the video plays, clips of a specific child are highlighted as the TV glitches to the next clip. Accompanying this mysterious collage is a distorted voice which cannot be heard in the video’s first loop. As the clips begin to repeat, the distorted voice becomes clearer.
			<p>
				As the final loop begins to unfold, the distorted voice becomes clear enough to piece together the true nature of this setting. This place is a prison and the audience is in the perspective of the person who killed the child seen throughout the video. The voice represents an undisclosed entity close to the child who places the audience’s character in an endless prison where they are forced to rewatch videos of the child they took. Every time the loop resets, the audience’s character doesn’t know the circumstances of the TV or what the distorted voice is saying. This represents how reflection often takes multiple times to fully grasp what has been done. 
			</p>
			<p>
				I wanted to explore a highly conceptual piece on revenge with a supernatural analog horror element encasing it. Created in Adobe Primiere Pro and voice effects on Logic Pro X, this concept was realized and its final effects in form.

		Aperiophobia is the fear of infinity. I was inspired to construct this piece by reflecting on my intense fear of the dark. Laying alone at night, staring into the seemingly infinite abyss that is the corners of my room, my imagination builds up monsters and demons that keep me still. Aperio references that phobia directly by playing into the fears of the infinite dark.
		<p>
			The piece begins throughout various locations of my residence. Often the same places I am afraid of at night are the same places I find comfort and joy in the daytime. I wanted to capture these environments and dissolve them into their most terrifying aspects by creating the same infinite darkness I fear. This represents how the fear of anything (in this specific piece, infinity) can make even happy places seem like nightmares. Where the door to my room is suddenly surrounded by infinite darkness waiting to swallow me whole. 
		</p>
		<p>
			These effects and this theme was made possible through the digital medium of video production. I was able to harness my abilities in lighting and atmosphere developed first in “Emily’s Chamber”. The analog horror elements supported the concept of Aperiophobia by use of Primiere Pro’s detailed color balancing features. Through this process, I was able to capture this phobia while controlling the fear that had been plaguing my nights for years on end.

	This purely audible track features soundscapes that develop a unique atmosphere which takes the audience through various scenes in their mind. I wanted to follow the similar progression of the likes of “Emily’s Chamber” and “Aperio” with how atmospheric and visual they were. With Swallow, the visual elements took on a new form by using music to allow the audience to imagine the visuals in their mind.
	<p>
		The overarching narrative throughout the track is of a star festival, celebrating the shooting stars as they cascade over the lands. What this festival brings however is a beast eager to feast upon the celebrating citizens. The festival then grows quiet as the beast roams the streets, looking for a tasty treat. Those unlucky to meet his needs can be heard screaming, their voices muffled through the dense stomach of the beast.
	</p>
	<p>
		I was inspired by “Super Mario Galaxy” and the opening festival scene. I wondered what it would be like had the festival turned sinister. With this piece I invite the audience to visualize whatever story they hear. The auditory medium, created using Logic Pro X, was the most effective way to realize this concept.

	This digital painting created on Procreate, utilized dry brush textures and traditional shading techniques to realize a daunting tunnel leading to an unknown destination. Accompanying the striking visual is a musical track created in Logic Pro X which compliments the tunnel’s mystery and introduces a story the audience is meant to fill in. Inspired by fairytales of “Alice in Wonderland” and “Coraline” with their portals to a whimsical world, I wanted to focus on the transition from a familiar destination to an unknown world.
	<p>
		The pictorial medium is one I have not been very familiar with and is further described to be where I feel most self conscious. This piece helped me ease my way into the pictorial medium and helped introduce lighting elements and storytelling. The process of creating art for me is to have an idea and then attempt to realize that through various mediums. In this case, it would be difficult to realize a tunnel in 3D versus using lighting and shading to infer depth in the pictorial realm. 
	</p>
	<p>
		The tunnel’s eye is the focal point with the yellow highlights guiding you both to the borders of the frame as well as the glow of the tunnel walls. I was able to capture the essence of transversal with a supernatural mystery enveloping it all.

<div class="statement">
	Animated using Procreate, this pixel art style animation sees iconic video game character Luigi dealing cards in a casino. I was inspired by the classic Luigi minigame on the DS. I recreated Luigi as well as developed an original casino setting (as the minigame I was inspired by took place in a carnival). Procreate’s animation tools made it possible to bring together not only the same aspect ratio as the DS, but also the game-like transitions from frame to frame.
	<p>
		The animation centers around a card game in which you must choose between three cards, which any of them could have the winning one. The blinking circle indicates where the player is hovering over a choice and ultimately chooses the winning card.
	</p>
	<p>
		The perspective of both a DS format as well as depth to show the paned glass of the casino as well as another table behind Luigi helps set the world and atmosphere for the animation. While it was difficult syncing Luigi’s movements together cohesively, the end result wound up being my first successful attempt at animation.
