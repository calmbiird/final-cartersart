			Admiring the view of her high rise apartment, Valerie casually smokes nude, reflecting on everything it took her to get to where she is. Raw was created within the “Cyberpunk 2077” game using the photo-mode feature which gives the user freedom to pose the characters, establish a three light scene, and adjust camera settings.
			<p>
				Through my experience being a photographer, I was able to transfer my abilities into this new form of the medium. The world of “Cyberpunk 2077” means a lot to me as the narrative inspires me to be brave, bold, and caring of others. The blurred background helps establish a haze that is first noted with the cigarette in hand. As a 3D modeler, I find it interesting how realistic artists can adapt the human body so I wanted to show the raw image of exactly that.
			</p>
			<p>
				I feel that the use of photo-mode broadened my scope of what is possible with art and how art can truly be made anywhere. The controller became my brush and my hope is to inspire those who feel they can only make art one way. I want to encourage them that it doesn’t matter how you do it or where you do it—it matters only that you do it and how it makes you feel.

		The character of So Mi in “Cyberpunk 2077” is one of misplaced tragedies. An orphan always on the run, So Mi is constantly chased down for her abilities. I wanted to capture the essence of always being under the spotlight through the use of Cyberpunk’s photo-mode. The character of So Mi is positioned on the ground as she looks up towards the camera. The camera emits a red hue that envelopes her. The color red symbolizes evil while the darkness beyond its circle is where she had always been hiding.
		<p>
			I was inspired by her story as I felt her pain. Feeling as though you can only hide and too afraid to show yourself. I wanted to adapt her story in a single frame. Baby Bird refers to a bird trapped in a cage, which So Mi is similar to. Her facial expression was deliberately chosen to be worried, complimenting the moral barrier between her and the camera.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the camera represents a watchful eye that has caught So Mi in her tracks, the camera also represents how privacy is becoming less common. Through the photo-mode feature and my background as a photographer, I was able to realize this concept.
