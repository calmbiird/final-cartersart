			Growing up, mental health had never been a priority for me. It never occurred to me that I needed to talk to someone—because what would I say? Would I tell them about how sad I was? No! I was doing so well! It was only when I experienced extreme heartbreak that I truly felt I had emotions bottled up and it took a massive toll on me and every corner of my life.
			<p>
				At the tailend of my girlfriend and I’s six month anniversary, her parents discovered her secret boyfriend—me. This caused severe ripples through our relationship, not only with each other but now with both of our parents. Being only 15 years old, I couldn’t stomach these emotions all at once. One minute I was holding the hand of the love of my life, the next I had tears running down my face. Her parents’ frustration with her led them to send her away to the Phillippines for two years. Still in shock from the months prior and challenged with this new heartbreak, my mental health was the worst it had been. I tried to show that I was okay to my classmates, my parents, and her. I got a summer job to help distract myself but the situation only worsened. I went to the bathroom to take deep breaths in between orders, I would call in sick, take less shifts, and be less enthusiastic in my position. I could no longer fake my mental state. My declining mental health bled outside my wire frame and into every aspect of my life. I realized how it was affecting me and decided it was time to talk to someone. After months of rehabiliation, my relationships with others and myself were finally healthy again.
			</p>
			<p>
				The motifs of Miyako are meant to emphasize how experiences just like mine are the reason why encouraging others to be outwardly spoken about the importance of openness regarding mental health can help foster a safer world for those struggling to speak out. Similar to the hidden meanings within Alieen’s title, Miyako’s name is an anagram of “I’m Okay”. This is meant to show the progression from a mask of fake happiness (I’m Okay) to adopting your true self again (Miyako). Within the wire frame is a lump in their throat which is a representation of how despite you saying that you’re fine, your mental health can affect you physically as well. The wire figure is positioned with its face turned away from the audience while it postures a thumbs up—a signal of joy and acceptance. One of the other materials act as a blindfold for their eyes as well as a hastily pieced together heart that you can still see the tape, emphasizing how fragile they are. Miyako serves to promote being open about mental struggles as well as bring awareness to how its antithesis can affect your life in all aspects.

		<div class="statement">
			My journey through the art world has always troubled me with an overwhelming sense of unbelonging—a feeling that I haven’t come to completely shake. The strive for perfection, an emphasis on inadequate technical experience, and self comparasion to competition accummulate to convince me that in the art world I am an alien among its citizens.
			<p>
				In my first semester at University, I attended my first ever drawing course. We were instructed to present what artwork we had done in the past and I offered to go first, excited to show my simple depiction of a fantasy dragon. When others went after me I was overwhelmed to see how much others had seemingly perfected the artwork I wanted to make. My dragon became less and less a staple of my beginner status and more of a mark of shame I wore around the prodigies I was surrounded by. Had I started drawing from an early age, had I been born with perfectly stable hands, had I lived the same lives as these students before me I could have had a drawing I was proud to stand against others’. This sense of unbelonging encompasses extreme self doubt that can destroy a creative mind. 

			</p>
			<p>
				The motifs used to create Alieen extend its message further to the viewer. The obvious alien-shape in the center stands alone as the only subject to emphasize its loneliness. The aura of a sunset palette erupts around it symbolizes the outward force of creativity. The outward most line of purple which is the same hue as the alien and separates the negative space from the sunset palette represents how it is often the limits we place on ourselves that drive this feeling of unbelonging. Although alien in shape, the figure has an anthropomorphic appearance in the form of a broken upper body. This represents how regardless of how alien we believe ourselves to be, we are human just like everyone else. The eyes of the alien are hazel colored to represent my personal journey coexisting with this emotion, as my own eyes are hazel. The second focus in the piece is the title name and its own layered meaning. Alieen enjoys the duality between its misspelling of “alien” and its original unique name. The underlying red squiggly line beneath it represents the acknowledgement of mistake; on the surface tagging “Alieen” as a misspelling of “alien” but its underlying meaning being that Alieen feels like they are a mistake that needs to change in order to fit in. The smudge mark from the ink that drives across the name represents how correcting this feeling can take time and it is not instant. Alieen serves to acknowledge this feeling that all artists experience in their journey and to remind them that they aren’t alone and that there is always room for them.
