			Experimenting with pictorial art, this hand-sketched line study was split among 12 panels each abstract in their own ways. Mounted onto a bristol board and highlighted in micron pen, these panels were the specific study of line weight and movement. With this series I wanted to deconstruct shapes into lines and let my hand flow as ideas popped into my head.
			<p>
				What came of it were 12 panels of highly abstract art which have little representations as the seed from which abstraction took form. The title, Juniper 12, refers to the 12 panels used as Juniper is a mysterious name, playing into the abstraction of the piece. The pictorial medium was helpful in perfecting the abstract element, allowing for mistakes to blossom into their own branches of creativity.

		Created in Adobe Illustrator using only the pen tool, this piece replicates the ”Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom” Amiibo. The symbol of the iconic Triforce behind the princess of Hyrule sets the piece deep within my interest in the series. 
		<p>
			As my first introduction to the program, my time was spent analyzing the source material while developing a beginning relationship with the pen tool of Adobe Illustrator. Described as a vector art project, Zelda is a love letter to the videogame series it adapts. 
		</p>
		<p>
			I wanted to depict the ideology of a princess and the mythos of royals. Zelda’s character design is decorated in ancient prospects while holding a decaying sword. This pose of Zelda from the Amiibo highlights TOTK’s narrative while paying homage to the series that brings me great joy.

<div class="statement">
	Inspired by the character of Wheatley from Portal 2 as well as the musical hero character of Lucio from Overwatch, this piece molds both characters through creative coding in the “p5.js” program. Lucio Bot is a combination of many of my interests: coding, illustrating, video games, and art. 
<p>
	Through this process I was able to think creatively as both a programmer and an artist as the program of “p5.js” has a steep learning curve. What began with a simple rectangle soon took the form of the original character you see above through trial and error.
</p>
<p>
	What I learned from my time in the program was how creative you can make coding and how it inspired me to pursue my interest in making video games.
