		<div class="statement">
			My overwhelming fear of the ocean haunts me beyond its waves. There is something so terrifying about the ocean and its vast emptiness. Looking over the ocean makes me feel insignificant compared to its size. The ocean emphasises the extensional dread I feel throughout areas of my life. 
			<p>
				It began when I was younger when I was swept out to sea in Half Moon Bay. My back faced the infinite ocean as it swallowed me whole. My parents rushed to me and pulled me out. The feeling of drowning would seep into my adult life. Large workloads and the stress of achieving perfection makes me feel insignificant. I relate feeling small to my experience at the beach. I was only but a small fish to the sea of infinity that I barely escaped from. No matter how far I run from it I still hear its call, beckoning me back to its shore to confront my overwhelming fears of being insignificant in its mouth of negative space.
			</p>
			<p>
				I achieved my theme through visual progression that introduced the landscape of the ocean and filled the frame exponentially as the camera zoomed in. The important aspects begin with the people at shore who are to give a scale comparasion. Next, the texture showed the animalistic nature of the ocean and how the waves are like scales to this massive beast that I saw the ocean as following my traumatic experience. Through the cloudy skies, unpredictable waves, and the seemingly neverending environment captured in my images, I was able to capture my fear of being insignificant while treading the same waters I found myself unable to escape from, now having enough courage to get out on my own.
